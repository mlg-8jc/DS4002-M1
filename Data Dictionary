The data this week comes from many different sources but originally came from the US Department of Education. The most comprehensive and easily accessible data cames from TuitionTracker.org who allows for a .csv download! Unfortunately it's in a very wide format that is not ready for analysis, but tidyr can make quick work of that with pivot_longer(). It has a massive amount of data, I have filtered it down to a few tables as seen in the attached .csv files. Tuition and diversity data can be quickly joined by dplyr::left_join(tuition_cost, diversity_school, by = c("name", "state")). Some of the other tables can also be joined but there may be some fuzzy matching needed.

Historical averages from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) - spanning the years 1985 - 2016.

Tuition and fees by college/university for 2018-2019, along with school type, degree length, state, in-state vs out-of-state from the Chronicle of Higher Education.
Diversity by college/university for 2014, along with school type, degree length, state, in-state vs out-of-state from the Chronicle of Higher Education.
Example diversity graphics from Priceonomics.
Average net cost by income bracket from TuitionTracker.org.
Example price trend and graduation rates from TuitionTracker.org
Salary potential data comes from payscale.com."

On Kaggle, we found a data set named “College tuition, diversity, and pay” [4]. More specifically, we are going to use the salary_potential.csv file. This dataset was published by Jesse Mostipak three years ago. It contains 945 observations with 7 characteristics for each. The relevant variables include:
rank: potential salary rank within state
name: name of school
state_name: name of state
early_career_pay: estimated early career pay in USD
mid_career_pay: estimated mid career pay in USD
make_world_better_percent: Percent of alumni who think they are making the world a better place
stem_percent: percent of student body in STEM
